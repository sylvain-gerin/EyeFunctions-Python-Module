# EyeFunctions-Python-Module
This python module contains different packages with various functions.
- the 'toolBox.py' module contains a rich set of functions used to handle python lists (not specific to eye-tracking).
- the 'preprocessing.py' module contains a set of functions that are necessary (and probably sufficient) to preprocess eye data converted in .asc, .csv, or .txt files.
- the 'analyse.py' module contains a set of functions allowing to perform simple analyses for time series (not specific to eye-tracking).

If you struggle using the module, please send your questions to sylvain.gerin@uclouvain.be
